# BetterEdit

The ultimate editor improvement mod. Adds a ton of <cp>utilities</c> and <cj>improvements</c> to the level editor, such as <cg>redesigned menus</c>, <cp>bug fixes</c>, <ca>keybinds</c>, and more!

## <cg>Features</c>

 * Better color selection menu
 * Better font selection menu
 * Better movement menu
 * View tab for quickly toggling on/off visuals
 * Scroll wheel improvements
 * Custom Grid sizes
 * Set offset for Group IDs in Next Free
 * Pinch to zoom on mobile
 * Custom UI scaling
 * Fully customizable editor keybinds
 * And lots, lots more!

## <ca>Restoring Old Backups</c>

Pre-2.206 versions of BetterEdit relied on the now-defunct BetterSave mod to create backups for levels. If you have backups from this time you'd like to restore, locate the old backups at `<GD Save Directory>/levels/<level-string-id>/backups`, and then move them to `<GD Save Directory>/betteredit-level-backups/<level-numeric-id>/backups`. The string ID (`<level-string-id>`) of a level is likely very close to its name except converted to kebab-case, and `<level-numeric-id>` can be seen in-game in the created levels list by enabling the `Show IDs in Search` option from the `Editor Level ID API` mod.

## <cy>Support</c>

BetterEdit is first and foremost **a passion project**, however it is also being developed by a poor student living on his own. If you would like to support development and help me out, I have a Ko-fi!
